# Datasets for Machine Learning

This repository (WIP) contains a collection of datasets for machine learning projects. It is linked to another project I'm working on, a [dataset collector application](https://github.com/gdcutting/dataset_collector) written in python.

## Dataset details:

- [airports_routes](airports_routes/) - FAA data on airports and flight routes.
